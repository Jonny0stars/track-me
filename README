What is Track Me?

Track Me is a simple set of perl scripts that are intended to be deployed on client machines
in order to offer faster and more secure support for home users.

Track Me will eventually -

* Allow admin access to the computer via RDP/VNC/SSH
* Download updates pushed to clients
* Cross platform
* Allow users to request support
* Allow further addons to Track Me

The basic concept involves giving users GnuPG identities in the support cycle, This identity
will be used to keep a track of any issues the users/clients have.

The identity will also be used to encrypt data to and from the Track Me server ensuring no
information is evesdropped.

The core concept of the program is home support as such Track Me is a guest on the users machine.
This means the program will not enforce any action upon the user unless they agree.
